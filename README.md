# Javascript Koans 

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node 8+ and NPM 5+
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `*.spec.js` files inside [`/test/`](/test/)

> Replace all `__` to fix failing tests

```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/hackages/javascript.typescript.training.git

# change directory to our repo
cd javascript.typescript.training

# start the server (`npm install` will be performed for you)
npm start or yarn start

```
go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser

**We use Mocha in this repository**

**For those using `yarn`, make sure to remove the `prestart` script before running `yarn**

**For those using **WallabyJS**, just run it and you'll be on your way to master JS syntax**
